### 🔗 Creating an open and decentralized 3D map of the world on Solana 🌐

We are building several ongoing projects:

- [MeshMap](https://meshmap.com) - A network of mappers, creators, players, hosts, and sponsors that contribute to the 3D map and receive onchain rewards.
- [MeshMap web app](https://meshmap.com/dashboard) - A Solana app for scanning, geotagging, minting, and mapping a decentralized 3D mesh of the world (coming soon!)
- [City Champ](https://docs.meshmap.com/games/city-champ) - An outdoor first-person combat, tower defense Augmented Reality (AR) game for Meta Quest 3.

Are you already part of our mapping network? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Learn more about [how to contribute](https://docs.meshmap.com).
