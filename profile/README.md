### 🔗 Creating a decentralized 3D mesh of the world on the Solana blockchain 🌐

We are building several ongoing projects:

- MeshMap - A network of mappers, creators, players, hosts, and sponsors that fulfill different roles in order to build the 3D map and earn onchain rewards.
- [MeshMap web app](https://meshmap.com/upload) - A Solana app for scanning, geotagging, minting, and mapping a decentralized 3D mesh of the world (coming soon!)
- [City Champ](https://github.com/MeshMap/CityChamp) - An outdoor first-person combat, tower defense Augmented Reality (AR) game for Meta Quest 3.

Are you already part of our mapping network? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Learn more about [how to contribute](https://meshmap.com/upload).
